              <h1>Our Story</h1>
              <p>
                Inspired by the marvelous novel "One Hundred Years of Solitude" by
                Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez, our humble coffee shop is a
                little homage to the greatest writer that the Spanish literature has
                had in the past century. Also being known as the land of coffee,
                Colombia has earned a worldwide fame for harvesting and producing the
                finest coffee beans. Brought to the UK by us since 2012, our products
                are carefully prepared in our coffee shop, where you can sit and relax
                for awhile in our comfortable sofas and read your favourite book or
                simply work with your laptop.

                Macondo was a remote village where its inhabitants were unaware of the
                progress from the society outside and all the magical phenomenons
                occured by what García Márquez described as "Magical Realism". Thanks
                to his effort in writing a novel that he never thought would have
                finished, he was awarded with the Nobel Prize of Literature back in
                1982. Today, we remember his life's greatest work along with a
                bookshelf with lots of other books which our customers are free to
                read while enjoying a coffee.
                <br/><br/>
                We want you to enjoy this experience and do not hesitate to contact us
                for any queries you may have!
